Use the code view and variables view on the right hand side to get the right values for fonts, colours, sizing etc.

When in code view, you can click on an element to view the details for it.

For the images, either try and screenshot/crop them out or replace them with generic images from elsewhere.

Produce the changes on a new branch and get the changes reviewed after each section is complete - e.g. do the header and first block, then get it reviewed.

CSS can be produced using plain CSS or using SASS, if you prefer.
